# [Advanced Learning Models:Kaggle data challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/advanced-learning-models)

The  main  goal  of  that  data  challenge,  which  is  part  of  the  Advance  learningmodels course (Ensimag), is to implement and evaluate an learning algorithmon structured data.  In this case it is about predicting whether a DNA sequenceregion is binding site to a specific transcription factor.Transcription  factors  (TFs)  are  regulatory  proteins  that  bind  specific  se-quence motifs in the genome to activate or repress transcription of target genes.Genome-wide  protein-DNA  binding  maps  can  be  profiled  using  some  experi-mental techniques and thus all genomics can be classified into two classes for aTF of interest:  bound or unbound.  In this challenge, we will work with threedatasets corresponding to three different TFs.For this work, no machine learning libraries are allowed.
